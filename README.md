# Show us what you can do

The goal is for us to get a deeper understanding of how you structure your code. Once you are done with the assignment, you will speak to one of our experts to elaborate on your thinking. We leave it up to you to spend the time you need to finish the project.

# The following things will be assessed by the technical screener:

    Fulfillment of the requirements
    Code cleanliness
    Project structure
    Commit history
    Tests and Testability

The scores and your test project will be part of your profile / candidate presentation to the customers. It highly increases your chances of landing a role and decreases the likelihood of a customer asking for yet another test project.
